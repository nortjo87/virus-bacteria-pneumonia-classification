Here we show the development of electronic nose as a low cost, noninvasive method for bacteria detection as cause of pneumonia in children. The development was evaluated using profiling test of 409 samples consisting of 170 bacteria samples, 52 viral samples and 187 control samples from 10 viral pneumonia, 40 bacteria pneumonia, and 50 control patients. 50 pneumonia patients were selected by medical personnel and confirmed using PCR at hospital located in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia to determine the cause of pneumonia. Four distinct mechanisms of machine learning, including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, K nearest neighbors, and logistic regression were harnessed to pinpoint the most effective pattern recognition techniques.
